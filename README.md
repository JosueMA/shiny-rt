# Reaction Time Distributions - An Interactive Overview
This is the code underlying [this guide](http://lindeloev.net/shiny/rt/). You can run it in RStudio or on a shiny server. I set up a free one at Google Cloud, which host it right now. If you expect fewer visitors, using RStudios built-in upload to [http://shinyapps.io](http://shinyapps.io) is very convenient. 

The file `index.html` is hosted locally at lindeloev.net to make Twitter Cards etc. work.
